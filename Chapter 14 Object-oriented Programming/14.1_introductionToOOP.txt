At the beginning of these notes, we came up with four basic programming patterns
which we use to construct programs:
    • Sequential code
    • Conditional code (if statements)
    • Repetitive code (loops)
    • Store and reuse (functions)

In later chapters, we explored simple variables and collection data structures
like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

As we build programs, we design data structures and write code to manipulate
those data structures. As programs get to be millions of lines long,
it becomes increasingly important to write code that is easy to understand.

Oject-oriented programming is concept to arrange your code so that you
can zoom into 50 lines of code and understand it while ignoring the other
999,950 lines of code.

This chapter only serves as an introduction to OOP. The key outcome is to
have a basic understanding of how objects are constructed, their 
functions, and their capabilities within Python and Python libraries.
