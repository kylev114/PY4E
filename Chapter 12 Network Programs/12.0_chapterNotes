The network protocol that powers the web has built-in support in Python called socket 
which allows network connections to retrieve data over those sockets in a Python program.

A socket is  like a file, except that a single socket provides a two-way connection between two programs.
You can both read from and write to the same socket.
If you write something to a socket, it is sent to the application at the other end
of the socket. If you read from the socket, you are given the data which the other
application has sent.

But if you try to read a socket when the program on the other end of the socket
has not sent any data, you just sit and wait. If the programs on both ends of
the socket simply wait for some data without sending anything, they will wait for
a very long time, so an important part of programs that communicate over the
Internet is to have some sort of protocol.

A protocol is a set of precise rules that determine who is to go first, what they are
to do, and then what the responses are to that message, and who sends next, and
so on. In a sense the two applications at either end of the socket are doing a dance
and making sure not to step on each otherâ€™s toes.

There are many documents that describe these network protocols. The Hypertext
Transfer Protocol is described in the following document:

socket; A network connection between two applications where the applications can
send and receive data in either direction.

port; A number that generally indicates which application you are contacting when
you make a socket connection to a server. As an example, web traffic usually
uses port 80 while email traffic uses port 25.

BeautifulSoup; A Python library for parsing HTML documents and extracting
data from HTML documents that compensates for most of the imperfections
in the HTML that browsers generally ignore.

scrape; When a program pretends to be a web browser and retrieves a web page,
then looks at the web page content. Often programs are following the links
in one page to find the next page so they can traverse a network of pages or
a social network.

spider; The act of a web search engine retrieving a page and then all the pages
linked from a page and so on until they have nearly all of the pages on the
Internet which they use to build their search index.
