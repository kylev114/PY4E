One of the common uses of the urllib capability in Python is to scrape the web
by parsing HTML files, similiar to reading through a text file in a definite loop.
Web scraping is when we write a program that pretends to be a web browser and
retrieves pages, then examines the data in those pages looking for patterns.

As an example, a search engine such as Google will look at the source of one web
page and extract the links to other pages and retrieve those pages, extracting links,
and so on. Using this technique, Google spiders its way through nearly all of the
pages on the web.

Google also uses the frequency of links from pages it finds to a particular page as
one measure of how “important” a page is and how high the page should appear
in its search results.
