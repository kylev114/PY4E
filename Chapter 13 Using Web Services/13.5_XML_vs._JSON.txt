You will notice some differences between XML and JSON files.
There are no comments in JSON files, they must be all read data.
In XML, we can add attributes like “intl” to the “phone” tag.
In JSON, we simply have key-value pairs. 
Also the XML “person” tag is gone, replaced by a set of outer curly braces.

In general, JSON structures are simpler than XML because JSON has fewer capabilities than XML. 
But JSON has the advantage that it maps directly to dictionaries and lists. 
And since nearly all other programming languages also use dictionaries and lists, 
JSON is a very natural format to have two cooperating programs exchange data.

JSON is quickly becoming the format of choice for nearly all data exchange between
applications because of its relative simplicity compared to XML.
