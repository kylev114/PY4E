<!--Here is a sample XML file:-->
<!--Each pair of opening (e.g., <person>) and closing tags (e.g., </person>) represents
a element or node with the same name as the tag (e.g., person). Each element
can have some text, some attributes (e.g., hide), and other nested elements. If
an XML element is empty (i.e., has no content), then it may be depicted by a
self-closing tag (e.g., <email />). It is best to compared to a branching family tree.
