implementation; a way of performing a computation; some implementations are better than others

The in operator uses different algorithms for lists and dictionaries. For lists, it
uses a linear search algorithm. As the list gets longer, the search time gets longer
in direct proportion to the length of the list. For dictionaries, Python uses an
algorithm called a hash table that has a remarkable property: the in operator
takes about the same amount of time no matter how many items there are in a
dictionary. I wonâ€™t explain why hash functions are so magical, but you can read
more about it at wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table.
